A few things I added for a project of mine: 1. all_boards can now filter, for example open (https://developers.trello.com/advanced-reference/member#get-1-members-idmember-or-username-boards) 2. Cards and boards parse dateLastActivity without needing another fetch (as it is returned in the original json).
None out the date_last_activity as I "promoted" it to the json parsing, so it'll be weird if it just didn't exist if parse failed.
How the hell did I manage to add tabs? :)
